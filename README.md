GinkoHub is a modern, performance-optimized developer portfolio built with **SvelteKit 5** and **Tailwind CSS 4.0**. It follows a "Cyber Flâneur" aesthetic—minimalist, pure black dark theme, and immersive nature backgrounds—blending tech-focused experiments with poetic wisdom.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🧩 Fully Modular Architecture

The project uses an advanced **Auto-Scanning Component System**. Adding new content is as simple as dropping a `.svelte` file into the right folder:

- **Modular Tabs**: Automatically builds navigation from `src/lib/tabs/`.
- **Feature Sections**: Each tab automatically scans its own `src/lib/features/<tab_name>/` directory.
- **Arcade Hub**: Games are automatically detected and added to the "Game" tab from `src/lib/features/game/`.

### 🖋️ Advanced Quote Image Generator

A professional-grade tool to generate and share wisdom:

- **Multiple Styles**: Choose from Minimal, Impact, Poetic, Cyber, or Glass themes.
- **Typography Engine**: Integrated font loading for Inter, Space Grotesk, Serif, and Monospace.
- **Creative Controls**: Real-time X/Y text positioning, font size scaling, and background brightness sliders.
- **Custom Backgrounds**: Use the site's nature images or upload your own.
- **Mobile Friendly**: Integrated **Web Share API** for one-tap sharing to social apps.
